This Alexa Skill was built for an Amazon promotion event. However, like almost every Amazon promotion event, they just try to waste your time and reject your work for [various reasons](https://www.chrisfinke.com/2016/11/25/rejected-for-being-childish-and-not-for-the-first-time/). So it only makes sense to open-source my project and try not to give Amazon a fudge anymore.

Nice work, Amazon.
